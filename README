                      Linux* HBAAPI Vendor Library
                      ============================

Introduction
------------

HBAAPI stands for Host Bus Adapter API (Applications Programming Interface).
It is a C-level shared library to manage Fibre Channel Host Bus Adapters.
The HBAAPI library source code may be downloaded from http://sourceforge.net/.
For a detailed description of HBAAPI please see the FC-HBA working draft in
http://www.t11.org/index.html. The HBAAPI shared library will also be built
when the vendor library is built, and will be named as libHBAAPI.so.

The HBAAPI vendor library is a shared library with functions that support
the API routines in the HBAAPI library. The HBAAPI vendor library will be
named as libhbalinux.so and is loaded by the HBAAPI library as a dynamic
library when the HBAAPI library is initialized. The vendor library invokes
the /sys file system for information of FCoE network adapters, local ports,
remote ports and discovered LUNs. It also gets adapter information with
the assistance from libpciaccess while the information are not available in
/sys. The ioctl calls are only used for SG_IO to issue SCSI commands to
generic scsi block devices. No ioctl are called to the libfc.ko or fcoe.ko
modules.

When applications are developed to link with libHBAAPI.so, they may
indirectly invoke libhbalinux.so behind the libHBAAPI.so. For instructions
of how to build and install the libraries, please see the file INSTALL.
