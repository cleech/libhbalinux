You may place it anywhere you like. Initially, the source tree contains

libhbalinux/
    include/
        ...
    src/
        ...
    patches/
        ...
    README
    INSTALL
    Makefile
    Makefile.hbaapi


Download hbaapi_src_2.2.tgz and patch the package
-------------------------------------------------

   Download hbaapi_src_2.2.tgz from http://sourceforge.net/projects/hbaapi/ or
   http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=35200&package_id=27501&release_id=143305
   The links may change, we do not have control to them.

   After the download is done, You may place hbaapi_src_2.2.tgz to anywhere you like.

   cd libhbalinux
   tar zxf <your path>/hbaapi_src_2.2.tgz
   cd hbaapi_src_2.2
   patch HBAAPILIB.c < ../patches/hbaapi2.2.patch


Build and install the libraries
-------------------------------

NOTE: Because the HBAAPI vendor library invokes the libpciaccess
      library.  The libpciaccess-devel package must be installed.

1) Because the HBAAPI vendor library invokes the libpciaccess library.
   The libpciaccess-devel package must be installed before you can
   build the vendor library.

2) Build and install the libraries.

   cd libhbalinux

   To build the libraries, issue

       make
       make install

   To cleanup the binaries, issue

       make clean
       make uninstall

3) After build is completed sucessfully, there are two libraries generated:
   libHBAAPI.so and libhbalinux.so.  The installation process adds the
   following files to the X86_64 system,

       /usr/lib64/libHBAAPI.so
       /usr/local/lib64/libhbalinux.so
       /etc/hba.conf

   On i386 system,

       /usr/lib/libHBAAPI.so
       /usr/local/lib/libhbalinux.so
       /etc/hba.conf

   The /etc/hba.conf file generated by the Makefile contains a line of ASCII
   string to indicate the location of the vendor library, i.e. libhbalinux.so,
   this allows libHBAAPI.so to load libhbalinux.so at initialization time.
