               HBAAPI Vendor Libraries Installation Guide
               ==========================================


Download hbalinux package from www.open-fcoe.org
-------------------------------------------------

Download the package of hbalinux from www.Open-FCoE.org and unpack it.
The default directory to place this source tree is /usr/local/src. You
may place it anywhere you like. Initially, the source tree contains

hbalinux/
    include/
        ...
    libhbalinux/
        ...
    patches/
        ...
    README
    INSTALL
    Makefile
    Makefile.hbaapi


Download hbaapi_src_2.2.tgz and patch the package
-------------------------------------------------

Next step is to download the hbaapi_src_2.2.tgz package, unpack it
and patch it.

   Download hbaapi_src_2.2.tgz from http://sourceforge.net/
   cd hbalinux
   tar zxf hbaapi_src_2.2.tgz
   cd hbaapi_src_2.2
   patch HBAAPILIB.c < ../patches/hbaapi2.2.patch


Build and install the libraries
-------------------------------

1) Build and install the libraries.

   cd hbalinux

   To build the libraries, issue

       make

   To cleanup the binaries, issue

       make clean

   To build and install the libraries, issue

       make install

   To uninstall the libraries, issue

       make uninstall

2) After build is completed sucessfully, there are two libraries generated:
   libHBAAPI.so and libhbalinux.so.  The installation process adds the
   following files to the X86_64 system,

       /usr/lib64/libHBAAPI.so
       /usr/local/lib64/libhbalinux.so
       /etc/hba.conf

   On i386 system,

       /usr/lib/libHBAAPI.so
       /usr/local/lib/libhbalinux.so
       /etc/hba.conf

   The /etc/hba.conf file generated by the Makefile contains a line of ASCII
   string to indicate the location of the vendor library, i.e. libhbalinux.so,
   this allows libHBAAPI.so to load libhbalinux.so at initialization time.
